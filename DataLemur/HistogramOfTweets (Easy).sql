This is the same question as problem #6 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets 
posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter 
users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number 
of users in each group.

tweets Table:
Column Name	Type
tweet_id	integer
user_id	    integer
msg	        string
tweet_date	timestamp

tweets Example Input:
tweet_id	user_id	msg	tweet_date
214252	    111	    Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.	12/30/2021 00:00:00
739252	    111	    Despite the constant negative press covfefe	01/01/2022 00:00:00
846402	    111	    Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!	02/14/2022 00:00:00
241425	    254	    If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is?	03/01/2022 00:00:00
231574	    148	    I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed	03/23/2022 00:00:00

Example Output:
tweet_bucket    users_num
1	            2
2	            1

Explanation:
Based on the example output, there are two users who posted only one tweet in 2022, and one user who posted two tweets in 2022. 
The query groups the users by the number of tweets they posted and displays the number of users in each group.
